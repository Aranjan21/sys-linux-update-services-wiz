## Description  
  
can you please add an action item for optimizing your execution of service start/stops?
I'd like to ensure you have the ability to use knife or a wrapper jenkins job that makes it go faster  
  
## CLI Example  
  
`knife jenkins create sys-linux-update-services-wiz --instance cloudops-jenkins --params '{}'`
